## 第一章 你是谁？

Suppose someone asked, “Who are you?” It would be simple enough to
respond with your name. But if the person wanted to know the entire
story about who you are, the question would be more difficult to answer.
You’d obviously have to give the details of your height, age, and weight.
You’d also have to include all your sentiments and preferences, even the
secret ones you’ve never shared with anyone—your affection for your
loved ones; your desire to please the people you associate with; your
dislikeof your older sister’s husband; your allegiance to your favorite
beverage, brand of clothing, and music.
Your attitudes couldn’t be overlooked either—your impatience when
an issue gets complex, your aversion to certain courses, your fear of high
places and dogs and speaking in public. The list would go on. To be com-
plete, it would have to include all your characteristics—not only the
physical but also the emotional and intellectual.
To provide all that information would be quite a chore. But suppose
the questioner was still curious and asked, “How did you get the way
you are?” If your patience were not yet exhausted, chances are you’d an-
swer something like this: “I’m this way because I choose to be, because
I’ve considered other sentiments and preferences and attitudes and have
made my selections. The ones I have chosen fit my style and personality
best.” That answer is natural enough, and in part it’s true. But in a larger
sense, it’s not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater
than most of us realize.

### The Influence of Time and Place

Not only are you a member of a particular species, _Homo sapiens_ , but you
also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a
particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by


```
CHAPTER 1 Who Are You? 5
```

specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which
limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. If you had
lived in America in colonial times, you likely would have had no objec-
tion to the practice of barring women from serving on a jury, entering
into a legal contract, owning property, or voting. If you had lived in the
nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young children
being denied an education and being hired out by their parents to work
sixteen hours a day, nor would you have given any thought to the spe-
cial needs of adolescence. (The concept of adolescence was not invented
until 1904.)^1
If you had been raised in the Middle East, you would stand much
closer to people you converse with than you do in America. If you had
been raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your par-
ents choose your spouse for you. If your native language were Spanish
and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused
by some English colloquialisms. James Henslin offers two amusing exam-
ples of such confusion: Chevrolet Novas initially sold very poorly in
Mexico because _no va_ in Spanish means “it doesn’t work”; and Perdue
chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion (or worse) because the
company’s slogan—”It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”—
became in Spanish “It takes an aroused man to make a chicken
affectionate.”^2
People who grow up in Europe, Asia, or South America have very
different ideas of punctuality. As Daniel Goleman explains, “Five min-
utes is late but permissible for a business appointment in the U.S., but
thirty minutes is normal in Arab countries. In England five to fifteen
minutes is the ‘correct’ lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian
might come two hours late, an Ethiopian still later, a Javanese not at all,
having accepted only to prevent his host’s losing face.”^3 A different ethnic
origin would also mean different tastes in food. Instead of craving a
New York Strip steak and french fries, you might crave “raw monkey
brains” or “camel’s milk cheese patties cured in dry camel’s dung” and
washed down with “warm camel’s blood.”^4 Sociologist Ian Robertson
summed up the range of global dietary differences succinctly:
“Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French eat snails but not lo-
custs. The Zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork.
The Hindus eat pork but not beef. The Russians eat beef but not snakes.
The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jalé of New Guinea find
people delicious.”^5 [Note: The reference to Hindus is mistaken.]
To sum up, living in a different age or culture would make you a dif-
ferent person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and
place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words,
they still would influence your responses.

### The Influence of Ideas^6

When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously
conveyed, logically and inescapably.^7 In logic, this kinship is expressed
by the term _sequitur,_ Latin for “it follows.” (The converse is _non sequitur,_
“it does not follow.”)^8

```
Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express
to young children as a way of encouraging them: “If you believe in your-
self, you can succeed at anything.” From this it follows that nothing else
but belief—neither talent nor hard work—is necessary for success. The
reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably
linked.*
In addition to conveying ideas closely linked to it in meaning, an idea
can imply other ideas. For example, the idea that there is no real difference
between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by
common moral standards. Samuel Johnson had this implication in mind
when he said: “But if he does really think that there is no distinction
between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count
our spoons.”
If we were fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implica-
tions of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the sound ones
from the unsound, the wise from the foolish, and the helpful from the
harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. In many cases, we take ideas at
face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associ-
ated meanings and implications. In the course of time, our actions are
shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of
them or not.
To appreciate the influence of ideas in people’s lives, consider the se-
ries of events set in motion by an idea that was popular in psychology more
than a century ago and whose influence continues to this day—the idea
that “intelligence is genetically determined and cannot be increased.”
That idea led researchers to devise tests that measure intelligence. The most
famous (badly flawed) test determined that the average mental age of white
American adults was 13 and that, among immigrants, the average Russian’s
mental age was 11.34; the average Italian’s, 11.01; the average Pole’s, 10.74;
and the average mental age of “Negroes,” 10.41.
Educators read the text results and thought, “Attempts to raise students’ in-
telligence are pointless,” so they replaced academic curricula with voca-
tional curricula and embraced a methodology that taught students facts but
not the process of judgment.
```

```
*The statement “Belief in oneself is an important element in success” is very different be-
cause it specifies that belief is not the only element in success.
```

```
CHAPTER 1 Who Are You? 7
```

Legislators read the test results and decided “We’ve got to do something to
keep intellectually inferior people from entering the country,” so they revised
immigration laws to discriminate against southern and central Europeans.
Eugenicists, who had long been concerned about the welfare of the human
species, saw the tests as a grave warning. They thought, “If intelligence cannot
be increased, we must find ways of encouraging reproduction among people
of higher intelligence and discouraging it among those of lower intelligence.”
The eugenicists’ concern inspired a variety of actions. Margaret Sanger’s
Planned Parenthood urged the lower classes to practice contraception.
Others succeeded in legalizing promoted forced sterilization, notably in
Virginia. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Virginia law with Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. declaring, “Three generations of imbeciles are
enough.”^9 Over the next five decades 7,500 women, including “unwed
mothers, prostitutes, petty criminals and children with disciplinary prob-
lems” were sterilized.^10 In addition, by 1950 over 150,000 supposedly “defec-
tive” children, many relatively normal, were held against their will in
institutions. They “endured isolation, overcrowding, forced labor, and phys-
ical abuse including lobotomy, electroshock, and surgical sterilization.”^11
Meanwhile, business leaders read the test results and decided, “ _We need policies
to ensure that workers leave their minds at the factory gate and perform their assigned
tasks mindlessly_ .” So they enacted those policies. Decades later, when Edwards
Deming proposed his “quality control” ideas for involving workers in decision
making, business leaders remembered those test results and ignored Deming’s
advice. (In contrast, the Japanese welcomed Deming’s ideas; as a result, several
of their industries surged ahead of their American competition.)
These are the most obvious effects of hereditarianism but they are
certainly not the only ones. Others include discrimination against racial
and ethnic minorities and the often-paternalistic policies of government
offered in response. (Some historians also link hereditarianism to the
genocide that occurred in Nazi Germany.)
The innumerable ideas you have encountered will affect your beliefs and
behavior in similar ways––sometimes slightly, at other times profoundly.
And this can happen even if you have not consciously embraced the ideas.

### The Influence of Mass Culture

In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes
the only, influence on children. Today, however, the influence exerted by
mass culture (the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and
popular music) often is greater.
By age 18 the average teenager has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom
and 22,000 hours in front of the television set. He or she has had perhaps
13,000 school lessons yet has watched more than 750,000 commercials. By
age thirty-five the same person has had fewer than 20,000 school lessons
yet has watched approximately 45,000 hours of television and close to
2 million commercials.


**8** PART ONE The Context

What effects does mass culture have on us? To answer, we need only
consider the formats and devices commonly used in the media. Modern
advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials
by celebrities. This approach is designed to appeal to emotions and create
artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people de-
velop the habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to
such appeals. They also tend to acquire values very different from those
taught in the home and the school. Ads often portray play as more fulfill-
ing than work, self-gratification as more desirable than self-control, and
materialism as more meaningful than idealism.
Television programmers use frequent scene shifts and sensory
appeals such as car crashes, violence, and sexual encounters to keep au-
dience interest from diminishing. Then they add frequent commercial
interruptions. This author has analyzed the attention shifts that television
viewers are subjected to. In a dramatic program, for example, attention
shifts might include camera angle changes;* shifts in story line from one
set of characters (or subplot) to another, or from a present scene to a past
scene (flashback), or to fantasy; and shifts to “newsbreaks,” to commercial
breaks, from one commercial to another, and back to the program. Also in-
cluded might be shifts of attention that occur within commercials. I found
as many as 78 shifts per hour, excluding the shifts within commercials.
The number of shifts within commercials ranged from 6 to 54 and aver-
aged approximately 17 per fifteen-second commercial. The total number
of attention shifts came out to over 800 per hour, or over 14 per minute.†
This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a
mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the workplace to
provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of
course, is an impossible demand, and when it isn’t met they call their
teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom
have the patience to read books that require them to think, many publish-
ers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.
Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published
authors, they are often directed to give short, dramatic answers during
promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. A man
who coaches writers for talk shows offered one client this advice: “If I ask
you whether the budget deficit is a good thing or a bad thing, you should
not say, ‘Well, it stimulates the economy but it passes on a burden.’ You

*This is typically accomplished by using two or more cameras and switching from one cam-
era to another.
†There are about eleven minutes of commercials per hour, the exact time varying by net-
work and program. Thus, at a rate of 4 per minute, the total number of commercials per
hour is 44. This calculates, therefore, to 78 shifts outside commercials plus 748 shifts
(17 shifts per commercial 44 commercials per hour) within commercials for a total of 826.

have to say ‘It’s a great idea!’ or ‘It’s a terrible idea!’ It doesn’t matter
which.”^12 ( _Translation_ : ”Don’t give a balanced answer. Give an oversim-
plified one because it will get you noticed.”)
Print journalism is also in the grip of sensationalism. As a newspaper
editor observed, “Journalists keep trying to find people who are at 1 or at
9 on a scale of 1 to 10 rather than people at 3 to 7 [the more moderate po-
sitions] where most people actually are.”^13 Another journalist claims,
“News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact. Journalists are
slipping into entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we
need to know.”^14
Today’s politicians often manipulate people more offensively than do
journalists. Instead of expressing their thoughts, some politicians find out
what people think and pretend to share their ideas. Many politicians hire
people to conduct polls and focus groups to learn what messages will
“sell.” They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words—that is
why we hear so much about “trust,” “family,” “character,” and “values”
these days. Political science professor Larry Sabato says that during the
Clinton impeachment trial, the president’s advisors used the term _private
lives_ over and over—James Carville used it six times in one four-minute
speech—because they knew it could persuade people into believing the
president’s lying under oath was of no great consequence.^15

### The “Science” of Manipulation

Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as
old as time, but manipulation did not become a science until the early
twentieth century, when Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology,
published his research on conditioned (learned) reflexes. Pavlov found
that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to
drool at the sound of the bell even when no food was presented. An
American psychologist, John Watson, was impressed with Pavlov’s find-
ings and applied them to human behavior. In Watson’s most famous ex-
periment, he let a baby touch a laboratory rat. At first, the baby was
unafraid. But then Watson hit a hammer against metal whenever the
baby reached out to touch the rat, and the baby became frightened and
cried. In time, the baby cried not only at the sight of the rat but also at the
sight of anything furry, such as a stuffed animal.* Watson’s work earned
him the title “father of behaviorism.”
Less well known is Watson’s application of behaviorist principles to
advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working for advertising
agencies and soon recognized that the most effective appeal to consumers

*Modern ethical norms would not allow a child to be used in such an experiment.


```
10 PART ONE The Context
```

was not to the mind but to the emotions. He advised advertisers to “tell
[the consumer] something that will tie him up with fear, something that
will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response,
or strike at a deep psychological or habit need.” His attitude toward the
consumer is perhaps best indicated by a statement he made in a presenta-
tion to department store executives: “The consumer is to the manufac-
turer, the department stores and the advertising agencies, what the green
frog is to the physiologist.”^16
Watson introduced these strategies in the 1920s and 1930s, the age of
newspapers and radio. Since the advent of television, these advertising
strategies have grown more sophisticated and effective, so much so that
many individuals and groups with political and social agendas have
adopted them. The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one
being people’s conviction that they are impervious to manipulation. This
belief is mistaken, as many researchers have demonstrated. For example,
Solomon Asch showed that people’s reactions can be altered simply by
changing the order of words in a series. He asked study participants to
evaluate a person by a series of adjectives. When he put positive adjectives
first—”intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious”—
the participants gave a positive evaluation. When he reversed the order,
with “envious” coming first and “intelligent” last, they gave a negative
evaluation.^17
Similarly, research has shown that human memory can be manipu-
lated. The way a question is asked can change the details in a person’s
memory and even make a person _remember something that never happened_!^18
Of course, advertisers and people with political or social agendas are
not content to stimulate emotions and/or plant ideas in our minds. They
also seek to reinforce those impressions by repeating them again and
again. The more people hear a slogan or talking point, the more familiar it
becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed
through careful thought. Sadly, “the packaging is often done so effec-
tively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind
at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat
like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a button and
‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has
performed acceptably without having had to think.”^19 Many of the beliefs
we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in
our minds in just this way.
Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that “a climate of opin-
ion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing that those who live
within it and know no other take it for granted.”^20 The rise of mass cul-
ture and the sophisticated use of manipulation have made this insight
more relevant today than ever.

CHAPTER 1 Who Are You? 11

### The Influence of Psychology

The social and psychological theories of our time also have an impact on
our beliefs. Before the past few decades, people were urged to be self-
disciplined, self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice self-
denial, to aspire to self-knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured
they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice.
“Hard work,” they were told, “leads to achievement, and that in turn pro-
duces satisfaction and self-confidence.” By and large, our grandparents
internalized those teachings. When they honored them in their behavior,
they felt proud; when they dishonored them, they felt ashamed.
Today the theories have been changed—indeed, almost exactly
reversed. Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce
defined as “an erroneous appraisement,” is now considered an impera-
tive. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and
people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered
heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with “a disease to please.”
The formula for success and happiness begins with feeling good about
ourselves. Students who do poorly in school, workers who don’t measure
up to the challenges of their jobs, substance abusers, lawbreakers—all are
typically diagnosed as deficient in self-esteem.
In addition, just as our grandparents internalized the social and psy-
chological theories of their time, so most contemporary Americans have
internalized the message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over
coffee; we hear it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challenges to its pre-
cepts are usually met with disapproval.
But isn’t the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No. A negative
perception of our abilities will, of course, handicap our performance.
Dr. Maxwell Maltz explains the amazing results one educator had in
improving the grades of schoolchildren by changing their self-images.
The educator had observed that when the children saw themselves as
stupid in a particular subject (or stupid in general), they unconsciously
acted to confirm their self-images. They believed they were stupid, so
they acted that way. Reasoning that it was their defeatist attitude rather
than any lack of ability that was undermining their efforts, the educator
set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished
that, _they no longer behaved stupidly_! Maltz concludes from this and other
examples that our experiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us,
suggesting a conclusion about ourselves and then urging us to make it
come true.^21
Many proponents of self-esteem went far beyond Maltz’s demonstra-
tion that self-confidence is an important ingredient in success. They
claimed that there is no such thing as too much self-esteem. Research


```
12 PART ONE The Context
```

does not support that claim. For example, Martin Seligman, an eminent
research psychologist and founder of the movement known as positive
psychology, cites significant evidence that, rather than _solving_ personal
and social problems, including depression, the modern emphasis on self-
esteem _causes_ them.^22
Maltz’s research documents that lack of confidence impedes per-
formance, a valuable insight. But such research doesn’t explain why the
more global concept of self-esteem has become so dominant. The answer
to that question lies in the popularization of the work of humanistic psy-
chologists such as Abraham Maslow. Maslow described what he called
the hierarchy of human needs in the form of a pyramid, with physiologi-
cal needs (food and drink) at the foundation. Above them, in ascending
order, are safety needs, the need for belongingness and love, the need for
esteem and approval, and aesthetic and cognitive needs (knowledge,
understanding, etc.). At the pinnacle is the need for self-actualization, or
fulfillment of our potential. In Maslow’s view, the lower needs must be
fulfilled before the higher ones. It’s easy to see how the idea that self-
esteem must precede achievement was derived from Maslow’s theory.
Other theories might have been adopted, however. A notable one is
Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl’s, which was advanced at roughly the
same time as Maslow’s and was based on both Frankl’s professional prac-
tice and his experiences in Hitler’s concentration camps. Frankl argues that
one human need is higher than self-actualization: _self-transcendence,_ the
need to rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, “the
primordial anthropological fact [is] that being human is being always di-
rected, and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a
meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or
a person to love.” A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself
and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.”
Making self-actualization (or happiness) the direct object of our pur-
suit, in Frankl’s view, is ultimately self-defeating; such fulfillment can
occur only as “the unintended effect of self-transcendence.”^23 The proper
perspective on life, Frankl believes, is not what it can give _to_ us, but what
it expects _from_ us; life is daily—even hourly—questioning us, challenging
us to accept “the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems
and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for [each of us].”^24
Finding meaning, according to Frankl’s theory, involves “perceiving
a possibility embedded in reality” and searching for challenging tasks
“whose completion might add meaning to [one’s] existence.” But such per-
ceiving and searching are frustrated by the focus on self: “As long as mod-
ern literature confines itself to, and contents itself with, self-expression—not
to say self-exhibition—it reflects its authors’ sense of futility and absurdity.
What is more important, it also creates absurdity. This is understandable in


```
CHAPTER 1 Who Are You? 13
```

light of the fact that meaning must be discovered, it cannot be invented.
Sense cannot be created, but what may well be created is nonsense.”^25
Whether we agree completely with Frankl, one thing is clear:
Contemporary American culture would be markedly different if the em-
phasis over the past several decades had been on Frankl’s theory rather
than on the theories of Maslow and the other humanistic psychologists.
All of us would have been affected—we can only imagine how
profoundly—in our attitudes, values, and beliefs.

### Becoming an Individual

In light of what we have discussed, we should regard individuality not as
something we are born with but rather as something acquired—or, more
precisely, _earned._ Individuality begins in the realization that it is impossi-
ble to escape being influenced by other people and by circumstance. The
essence of individuality is vigilance. The following guidelines will help
you achieve this:

1. _Treat your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative._
   No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until you
   have examined it.
2. _Decide why you reacted as you did._ Consider whether you borrowed
   the reaction from someone else—a parent or friend, perhaps, or a
   celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine
   what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.
3. _Think of other possible reactions you might have had to the person, issue, or_
   _situation._
4. _Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than_
   _your first reaction._ And when you answer, resist the influence of your
   conditioning.
   To ensure that you will really be an individual and not merely claim
   to be one, apply these guidelines throughout your work in this book, as
   well as in your everyday life.

### Applications

_Note: One of the best ways to develop your thinking (and writing) skills is to record your
observations, questions, and ideas in a journal and then, as time permits, to reflect on
what you have recorded—considering the meaning and application of the observations,
answering the questions, elaborating on the ideas (and, where appropriate, challenging
them), and recording your insights. An inexpensive bound notebook or spiral notebook
will serve the purpose. A good approach is to record your initial observations, questions,
and ideas on the left side of the page, leaving the right side blank for your later analysis
and commentary. The value of this reflective process is so great that you should consider
keeping such a journal even if your instructor does not make it a formal part of the course._

1. Do a brief study of attention shifts such as the one described in the
   chapter. Record a half-hour show. Then play the show back twice, the first time
   counting the number of shifts within the program, excluding commercials, and
   the second time counting only those within commercials. Complete the neces-
   sary arithmetic and be prepared to share your results in class.
2. Reflect on your findings in application 1. Write several paragraphs
   discussing the implications of those findings for education, business, and
   family life.
3. Many people cheerfully pay $6 or $7 a gallon for designer drinking water
   but moan and groan when they have to pay $3 a gallon for gasoline. Does any-
   thing you read in this chapter help you understand why this is so?
4. Imagine how different America might be if Frankl’s emphasis on self-
   transcendence and personal responsibility, rather than Maslow’s emphasis on
   self-actualization and popular culture’s emphasis on self-esteem, had been domi-
   nant for the past fifty years. List as many ways as you can in which our society
   might be different today and comment on whether each would be beneficial or
   harmful. Be prepared to explain your views in class discussion.
5. Watch one of the music video channels—MTV, VH1, CMT, BET— for
   at least an hour. Analyze how men and women are depicted in the videos. Note
   significant details. For example, observe whether men are depicted in power
   roles more than women and whether women are portrayed as objects of male
   desire. Decide what attitudes and values are conveyed. (You might want to
   record as you are watching so that you can review what you have seen, freeze
   significant frames for closer analysis, and keep your observations for later refer-
   ence or class viewing and discussion.)
6. Suppose you asked a friend, “How did you acquire your particular
   identity—your sentiments and preferences and attitudes?” Then suppose the
   friend responded, “I’m an individual. No one else influences me. I do my own
   thing, and I select the sentiments and preferences and attitudes that suit me.”
   How would you explain to your friend what you learned in this chapter?
7. Ask yourself the question, Who am I? Write down ten answers to this
   question, each on a separate slip of paper. Use the first three paragraphs of this
   chapter to help you frame your answers. Arrange the pieces of paper in order of
   their importance to you. Then explain the arrangement—that is, which self-
   descriptions are most important to you, and why?
8. Identify the various positive and negative influences that have shaped
   you. Be sure to include the particular as well as the general and the subtle as well
   as the obvious influences. Which of those influences have had the greatest effect
   on you? Explain the effects as precisely as you can.
9. Note your immediate reaction to each of the following statements. Then
   apply the four guidelines given in this chapter for achieving individuality.
   a. Health care workers should be required to be tested for HIV/AIDS.
   b. Beauty contests and talent competitions for children should be banned.
   c. Extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan should be allowed to hold rallies
   on public property or be issued permits to hold parades on city streets.
   d. Freshman composition should be a required course for all students.
   e. High school and college athletes should be tested for anabolic steroid use.
   f. Creationism should be taught in high school biology classes.

they prescribe birth control devices or facilitate abortions for the minors.
k. A man’s self-esteem is severely injured if his wife makes more money

10. _Group discussion exercise:_ Discuss several of the statements in application 9
    with two or three of your classmates, applying the four guidelines presented in

    ideas with the class.

### A Difference of Opinion

The following passage summarizes an important difference of opinion. After
reading the statement, use the library and/or the Internet and find what knowl-
edgeable people have said about the issue. Be sure to cover the entire range
of views. Then assess the strengths and weaknesses of each. If you conclude
that one view is entirely correct and the others are mistaken, explain how you
reached that conclusion. If, _as is more likely,_ you find that one view is more
insightful than the others but that they all make some valid points, construct
a view of your own that _combines_ insights from all views and explain why that
view is the most reasonable of all. Present your response in a composition or an
oral report, as your instructor specifies.

Should captured terrorists be tried in military or criminal courts? When
the United States decided to use the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
to detain individuals captured on the battlefield in the Iraq war, many peo-
ple protested the decision. Some argued that captured individuals should be
considered criminals rather than prisoners of war and accorded the rights
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to all people accused of crimes. Others
argued for classifying the individuals as prisoners of war and treating them
